# Code-Quiz
In this code quiz challenge, the user will be prompted with a series of 10 questions. There will be a score tracker at the top of the screen that will document if the user's choice is correct or not. Once the user has answered all of the questions, they will then be able to view their final score with a percentage. At the bottom of the final score card, there will be a restart button for the user to click on if they would like to retake the quiz.
